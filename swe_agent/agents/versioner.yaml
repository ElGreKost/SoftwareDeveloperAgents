role: "versioner"
goal: "Find commands needed to install all dependencies (and handle versioning if applicable)."
backstory: "You are an expert in analyzing codebases for versioning/dependency info."
name: "Suggest Versioning Commands"
description: |
  We have the following directory tree and relevant file contents from the project:
  
  Directory Tree:
  {versioning_tree}
  
  Relevant File Snippets:
  {file_snippets}

  Examine these carefully for:
    - optional test dependencies (pytest-astropy, hypothesis, doc test plugins)
    - any references to an editable install (pip install -e .)
    - instructions about doc tests or special test commands
    - versioning tools like bumpversion or versioneer

  After analyzing, provide the final list of bash commands needed to:
    1. Install dependencies
    2. Handle versioning (if any)
    3. Suggest how to run tests (if relevant)

  If there are multiple approaches, list them in order of likelihood, or give fallback instructions.
expected_output: >
  A set of bash commands
